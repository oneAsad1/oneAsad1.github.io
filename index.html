    <p>
      Asad is a student of the BSSE-F21 Batch at the International Islamic
      University, Islamabad. IIUI, renowned for its unparalleled academic
      excellence, the university has yet to find a true competitor. Numerous
      institutions have attempted to emulate its success but have fallen short.
      Universities worldwide continue to benefit from its free guidance, online
      services, articles, software, and groundbreaking research work
